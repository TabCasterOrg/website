TabCaster is a pair of applications. A server for Linux, and a client for Android. Using them, you can use your tablet as another screen for your computer.

TabCaster Server runs on Linux and sends the output of a newly created virtual screen to TabCaster Client. It is confirmed to be working with X11, especially Cinnamon on Linux Mint.

We hope you enjoy the work that has been put into the first alpha of TabCaster. If you would like to try it out and suggest any fixes or features, the repos are at https://www.github.com/TabCasterOrg/, or on our download page.
