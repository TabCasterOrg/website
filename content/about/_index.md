## What Is TabCaster?

TabCaster is a pair of applications designed to allow X11 Linux users to cast a secondary virtual screen to their Android tablet. 

The main issue TabCaster fixes is that there is currently no consistent easy out-of-the-box way to create a completely new screen using a tablet. With TabCaster, this is now possible.
